Welcome to Yogi-Posi-Tracki!!!

This is an app to track your progress on a large number of yoga poses
and see the progress you are making. When you select a pose you will have
the choice to see the pose info or add it to your progress. The info will
provide you with how to get into it, the muscles and joints that benefit
from the pose as well as the intensity level. If you add it to your
progress it will add cards to your progress page. The progress Page
will put the pose you chose in an editable card where you will tell it
the time you spent practicing the pose and other comments about your
progress with the pose. Enjoy!
